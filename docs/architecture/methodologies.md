# Development Technologies

## Domain Driven Design (DDD)

This is a development approach where developers and stakeholders together model the business domain, aiming at understanding it, to be able to easily develop and maintain a software solution.

## Test Driven Development (TDD)

Test Driven Development is an idea where testing is made a part of the development routine by creating unit test to test behavior.

A common method when using TDD is Red-Green-Refactor (RGR) workflow. The RGR workflow works like this:

* You write a test for a behavior in your application, this test must fail because that behavior is yet to be implemented (the Red stage).

* Next, you implement the minimum amount of code to make your test pass (the Green stage).

* Finally, you check if the code can be refactored and simplified further (the Refactor stage).

_This is repeated throughout the application and these processes will be used to build out the entire application._
